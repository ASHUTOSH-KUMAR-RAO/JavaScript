# JavaScript and Classes :-

## OOp
- oops means object Oriented Programming
- oops is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design applications and programs.
- oops is a way of writing code that is easy to read, write, and maintain.

## Object =>
- collection of Propertise(Variabels and Constant) and Methods(Functions)

## parts of OOp :-
- constructor Functions
- Prototype
- classes
- Instances(new,this and many more)

## Four Pillars Of OOp :-
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

### Inheritance :-
- Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
- The class that inherits the properties and methods is called the subclass or derived class.
- The class from which the properties and methods are inherited is called the superclass or base class.
- Inheritance is used to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.

### Abstraction :- (Details Hide kaar lena ,eg:- Fetch => kyuki ye bts mein bahut kaam krta hai. ❤️)
- Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal details.

- Abstraction is used to reduce complexity and make the code more manageable.

### Polymorphism :- (iska mtlb hota hai ki ye ek hi methods se bahut sara kaam kr deta hai ❤️)
- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms.

- Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.

- Method overloading is when multiple methods with the same name can be defined but with different parameters.

- Method overriding is when a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its

### Encapsulation :- (Basically iska mtlb hota hai data ko wrappep kar dena means ki mthod,function ye saab kuch hide kr dena ❤️)
- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class.

- Encapsulation is used to hide the internal details of an object from the outside world and provide a controlled interface to access and modify the data.
